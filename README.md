The "Simple House Design with CSS" project provides an example of how to create a basic house design using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The design incorporates CSS properties such as `position`, `width`, `height`, `background`, `border-style`, `border-width`, `border-color`, `border-radius`, and `display` to create a visually appealing house illustration.
